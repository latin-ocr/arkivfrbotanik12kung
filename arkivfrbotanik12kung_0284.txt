Many years later, in revising the Arctic Cruciseroe of
the Botanical Museum of Copenhagen O. GELERT discovered
that 1116 Norwegian D. imavo-hirta HARTM. was identical
with the Greenlandic Draba arctica J. WAHL. (Flora Danica
1840 fasc. 39 tab. 2294), O. GELERT: Notes on Arctic Planus,
Botanisk Tidskrift, 21 bind., 311., Kjobenhavn 1898, p. 307),

Following GELERT Messrs NEUMAN and AHLFVENGREN
adopted this name in their Sveriges Flora 1901 p. 474,
with Draba {mano-hirta (p. p.) as a synonym; and Draba
rupestris was given as an independant 5966165 with the
diagnosis in closer correspondence to that of R. BROWN in
Hortus Kewensis ed. 2 t. IV (1812) 9. 91.

1. Draba magellanica LAM.

The characteristics by which Draba arctico. is distin-
guished from Northern Lcmccodrabae, especially D. rupestris
are as follows: The growth is taller than that of D. ru-
pestris, the leaves of t-he sterile rosella of the first year ex-
clusively ent-ire, the stem of higher individuals has 2-6
leaveS, the pedicels are often 961111616, the flowers large --
the petals 4-6 mm. — the sepals light-coloured and hairy
and, last but not least, the covering of the rosulate leaves con-
sists almost only of stellulate 116115 111016 01 1655 branched. Ac-
cording 10 1116 diagnosis of J. WAHL, only specimens with 6
very dense pubescence have been designated D. arctica,
whereas more glabrous ones but with the same sort of co-
vering and other characters have been referred 10 D. incano-
hirta or 10 1116 comprehensive term of »Draba hirta». Ι1 15
probably on account of this fact that some botanical authors
have formed the opinion that there is no strict line of de-
marcation between D. arctica and ›>D. hirta». Accordingly
they have classed D. arctica only as a subspecies 10 ›>D.
