EKMAN, NOMENCLATURE OF SOME NORTH-EUROPEAN DRABAE. t

J. DICKSON on Ben Lawers and under the name of Draba
stellata mentioned by him in Transaction of Linnean Soc. t.
II p. 288 (1793). In Flora Britannica p. 677 (1800) it is
called D. hirta by J. Ε. SMITH, which name he also used in
'English Botany 1804 where the plant is represented
vol. 19 tab. 1338. 111 August 1793 R. BROWN collected this
plant himself and under his type specimens in the Nat. Hist.
Mus in London he 1163 noted locality‚ date and the name.
›>D. stellata· JACQ.2›> As to habit this Scottish D. rupestris
does not seem to vary very much, but on the contrary as
to the pubescence of the leaves. One of the specimenS, in
the Nat. Hist. Museum, of which I made a sketch through
the microscope has a pubescence of both stellulate‚ forked
and simple hairS, the latter kind, however, in the majority.
With such a heterotrichous pubescence‚ though varying in
its combination‚ J. W. HOOKER has described D. rupestrz‘s
in Flora Boreali-Americana Ι p. 53 (1840) which plant he
had gathered for many successive years on Ben Lawers

With a heterotrichous pubescence it is also represented by
L. REICHENBACH (in Icones Florae Germanicae tab. 4245),
though the stellulate hairs there seem to be dominant.

I have, however, seen specimens from the same locality
(collected in September 1911 by Professor C. LINDMAN) on
which the stellulate hairs are quite missing and only bifurc-
ous and simple hairs occur. Upon such 6 specimen the
diagnosis of J. E. SMITH l. l. c. c. was founded. As mention—
ed, SMITH also 1163 called the plant D. hirta. The fruit of
D. rupestris also varies, Generally it is pubescent but- some-
times also glabrous The description of R. BROWN includes
both the forms, He describes the fruit as bairy. such as it
is in most specimens. The characteristics of both forms
are: the lower growth — the tallest specimens 11—12 cm.
-— the entire or slightly serrated leaves of the rosella. the
hairy stalk, which is leafless or only has a single leaf, the
pubescence of simple or bifurcous hairs in the rosulate leaveS‚
the upright or slightly patulate pedicels‚ which are shorter
than the ovate, lanceolate podS, the short style, t-he small,
white flowers and the bairy sepals

For the form which has stellulate hairs on the leaves,
I should like 10 propose the name of D. rupestris R. BROWN,
