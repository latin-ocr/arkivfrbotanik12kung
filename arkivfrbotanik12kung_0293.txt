EKMAN, NOMENCLATURE OF SOME NORTH-EUROPEAN DRABAE. ll

D. sladnizensis. If this be right the name of the form
should be: D. sladnizensz's WULF. f. lactea ADAMS.

Besides D. Zapponica We. there are often found in the
Scandinavian collections forms of D. rupestris under the name
of D. sladnizensis, These are specimens with serrated leaves
or pubescence on the stem, a stouter stem and larger, even
when dried, pure white flowers. The true D. sladnizensz's
has always very small flowers; the petals about two mm.
A form of D. rupes-tris or an intermediate one with a few
hairs on the stem has wrongly been called D. sladnizensz's
s. altaica. Draba altaica BUNGE is a form of D. rupestrz's
distinguished by its pods which at least in immaturate state
are gat-hered in a Capitate corymb. This species uas also
referred to D. rupestris in Flora Altaica tom. III p. 72. The
illustration of it in Icones Plant. Flor. Rosa tab. 260 agrees
completely with specimenS, communicated by BUNGF. him-
sels, which I have seen in the Nat. Hist. Mus, in London. —
From localities in Central Europe there are often found in-
t-ermediate formS‚ probably hybrids, between D. sladm'zensis
and Draba carinthiam HOPPE. Bot. Zeit. 6 (1823) p. 437. They
are distinguished by some stellulate hairs on the sursace or
in the margins of the leaveS, sometimes also on the stem,
higher growth and longer pedicels The style is always al-
most insensible, as with both the parents, especially D. ca-
rinthiam. I point this out by way of contrast to what is often
the case in intermediate forms in the North, where D. alpina
probably is the one parent.

In the Flora Italiana by PARLATORE and CARUEL vol. 9
p. 770 D. carinthiam is given as a synonym to D. slad-
nizensz's!

The reason why this species has been so confused with
other affined forms is perhaps in a certain degree to be ascrib-
ed to the actual wording of the diagnosis. WVhen v·
WULFEN says that the stems are ›>nudi», this word to be
rightly understood must be amplified with another attribute
he gives it, viZ. 2 or 3 leaves, As has been shown, these 2
or 3 leaves are not always found in nature, and therefore
some authors has omitted this charact-er, whereby the word
›>nudi›> has obtained another signification and the diagnosis
has become misleading. Another reason is probably the
mere existence of many intermediate forms between D. slad-
