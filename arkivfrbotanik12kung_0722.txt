The proportion 0,75 for samples with one {lower-stalk
(which lies nearly between the limits indicated by the mean
error) suggests the possibility of an explanation of the found
proportions on MENDELEAN grounds,

2. N umber os stamens, There vere 173 samples examined
in regard to this character. The number of stamens varied
between 5 and 9, the distribution of the 173 samples being
the following:

N p
Number of samples having 5 stamens l, 0,0058 ss O‚0058
6 >> 38, O‚2197 ss 0,0315
³ 130, O,7514 ss 0.0329
8 » 3, 0‚0173 ὲ 0,0099
9 1, Ο,0058 ss O‚0058

Summa 173, l,0000

The standard number of stamens is, as well known, 7
and occurs in 75 ⁰4, of the observed cases, The uncertainty
(= mean error) of this proportion amounts to 3 (ὶὲ).

For examining the correlation between the number of
stamens and the number of stalkS, I have counted the number
of stamens separately for samples with l, 2 and 3 flower-
stalks. The result was

Number of samples having
l stall< 2 stalks 3 stalks

Number of stames = 5 l Ο 0

= 6 32 6 Ο
-- 7 99 28 3
= 8 3 Ο Ο
= 9 O l O

Sum 135 35 3

 

Dividing by the total number of individuals of each class
we find the following values of the probabilities with
their mean errorS.
