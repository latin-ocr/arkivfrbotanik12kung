p. 255). Professor C. LmDMAN, who has seen it, had had the
kindness to give me a sketch and a description of this Lin-
nean Draba. The specimen is incomplete but the long pe-
dicels and the covering of only stellulate hairs of the leaves
are sufficiently marked characteristica LINNAEUS called it:
»Di-aba caule ramoso ίοῑὶοεο, jolii-s demntia» and referred it
thus to Draba incana L.

2. Draba hirta L.

As D. mayellanica is thus not the Draba hirta of Lm-
NAEUS, one might be tempted to conclude it to be some gla-
brous form of Draba rupestrz's R. BR. — LINDBLOM‚ (ll. c. c.).
But this plant is not his D. hirta either. The type specimen,
which I have had the opportunity of seeing in the herbarium
of LINNAEUS in the Linnean Society in London, corresponds
completely with the diagnosis and description l. l. c. c.‚ the
word ›>hirta›> being interpreted to mean: »hairy with simple
hairs». As far as I could see, the hairs were only cilia of
about one mm. in length. The rather robust stem had
only one leaf under the lowest pedicel. The pods are about-
12 mm. long on short-er somewhat patulous pedicels,
Under the plant or rather the two plants —for at the right
of D. hirta there is another plant which is no Draba but
a Braya alpina STERXB. et HOPPE —— LINNAEUS has written in
his own hand »hirtam and the locality »Lapym On the other
side of the sheet of paper he has afterwards noted: »Carda-
mine soliis obtusis sessilibus ad radicem in rosulum dispositi&
siliquis brevibus Gmel.» The quotation is from the Flora
Sibirica of GMEL. tom. ΙΙΙ 1763 p. 272, where the plant also
is represented fig. 66 n:o 3. The plant of GMELIN is no
doubt a Draba and resembles the D. hirta but it is not the
same plant. This is probably the meaning of the word »rim
which SMITH has written in pencil under LINNAEUS’ quotation.

I have in vain sought amongst Scandinavian Drabae in
the collectione for a plant corresponding with the Linnaean
D. hirta. Neither have I found one in nature. Among non-
Scandinavian Drabae it corresponds pretty closely with the
