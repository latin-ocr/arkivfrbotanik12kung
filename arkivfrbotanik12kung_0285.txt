EKMAN, NOMENCLATURE OF SOME NORTH-EUROPEAN DRABAE. 3

Ι cannot but consider this splittning up of the species
as both unnatural and irrational. As the kind of covering, and
not the density of it, is the most constant characteristic in the
genus of Draba, (as prooved by culture) it is on the former that
the determination. of the species must be mainly based.

In Dovre in Norway where I have had the opportunity
of studying the species D. arctica from nature for several
successive years, both the specimens with very dense cover-
ing and more glabrous ones are found, the former on rocks
exposed to hard wind, the latter in shady or moist localitieS.
In dark valleys the plant often becomes taller‚ with its
style somewhat longer, on poor soil it becomes slender with
scanty flowerS, f. paucijlora LANGE. (Conspectus Florae Groen-
landiae p. 44 in Meddelelser om Groenland ΙΙΙ 1880).

D. arctico. is a capital name, but has the fault of beeing
too young. Ι have not seen the type of Draba cla-sycarpa
G. A. MEY. (Flora Altaica 1821 p. 79) but from the excellent
illustration of it in Icones Plantarum Flor. Rossic. tab. 264
one may conclude with certainty that it is identical with
D. arabica. Draba subamplexicaule C. A. MEY. l. l. c. c. p.
77 and tab. 265, is a very glabrous form of it, probably from
a watery locality.

I do not venture to say that Draba cinei-ia. ADAMS (in
Memoire des naturalistes de Moscou t. V (1817) p. 103) is
the same plant, though there are many reasons for believ-
ing so, There is in British Museum, Natural History, a
typical D. arctz'ca with the designation: »D. cineria Anfflst»
Nor does the description of D. cineria l. e. run counter
to this.

However, neither the name of D. dasycarpa nor that of
D. cineria is the oldest one for our plant. Strange to say,
the name which rightly belongs to D. arctico. was first assign-
ed to an Antarctic plant viz, Draba mayellanica LAM. In
the collection at Kew I have seen a specimen of D. mayel-
lanz‘ca from the herbarium of the late J. D. Hooxmz, the
author of Flora Antarctica. In this work part 2 p. 233, where
'Hoossmz refers D. mayellam‘ca LAM. to Draba- incana L.
under which name he also includes »Draba confusa Ena»,
he mentions that he has only seen one specimen of this
plant, which was derived from the herbarium of »ΜΓ GOUAN»
