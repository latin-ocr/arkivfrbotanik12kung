WINGE, CYTOLOG. STUDIES IN THE PLASMODIOPHORACEAE. 25

by (ΙΑΗΝ40 1907. Here JAHN found 4 nuclei in the mature
Spore and these divide at the germination into 8 nuclei,
' whereupon 8 swarming-spores are formed. JOHNSSON’S ob-
servations are, however, contradicted by later observations
(see belowl). — In connection with this fungus must be men-
tioned a memoir by HoRNE.4¹ The author has on Pteris found
an organism in the cellular tissue of the rhizome-apiceS. Ac-
cording to his description and bad illustrations we have
reason to believe that all his »bodies›> are oil-globules, pre-
cipitation·‚ degeneration- and other phenomena in the tissue
of the host-plant. Recently both OsssoRN42>24 and HORNE43
have given their opinions on Sponqospora. We here cite some
of OSBORN’s results: The amoebae are only distributed pas-
sively in the host-plant (by the cell-divisions of the host-
plant) — not actively as MAssEE44 assumes, Polar radiations
from the nuclear spindles do not occur in Sponqospora nor
centrosomes at the vegetative stage. The uninucleate nuclei
of the small amoebae divide amitotically, the amoebae also
divide, hence only small amoebae are found. At the close
of the vegetative phase they fuse and form a plasmodium in
which the nuclei disappear, so that only vacuoles remain
(›>akaryote stage»); the chromatis} moves out into the plasma.
Totally new nuclei are formed and these fuse two and two,
The fusion-nucleus divides mitotically twice. The spores are
uninucleate. —— OSBORN never succeeded in bringing the. spores
to germination, but· according to MASSEE (l. c.) the contents
of the spore is at the liberation of a regular roundish form
with a few projecting pseudopodia. The movement is slow
and only lasts a short time. - OSBORN (J. c.) declares that
a caryogamy certainly will be found also in other Plasmo-
diophoraceae(!). ——- From OSBORN's detailed figures and de-
scriptions it seems as if a caryogamy really takes place in
Sponyospora —— and in this case the fungus must be removed
from the Plasmodiophoraceae. A revision of OsBORN's results
would be of great interest. ⁴
PAVILLARD53 also supposed, that a caryogamy would be
found in all the Plasmodiophoraceae. But we do not agree
with this author when he writes about this quest-ion in his
last notice54: . . . cet-te absence (of the caryogamy) est loin
d’etre demontree...» If a caryogamy at this stage is
