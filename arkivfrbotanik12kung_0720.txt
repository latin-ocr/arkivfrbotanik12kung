bias for more stately and conspicuous specimens I had, practi-
cally, all specimens gathered at a certain spot of the wood
(at the north side of the so called »Persian bay»). In all
469 samples were examined.

From the primary observing list 3 card cataloyue was
formed. Such 3 card catalogue is indispensible as soon 33
more than one character in a given populationis considered.
The mode of treatment of the material was that given in
my »Grunddragen af den matematiska statistiken›>.1

According to the classification of statistical problems
given in this pamphlet, I consider here separately A) Homo-
9rade statisticS, where only the number of samples having a
certain character —- and not the intensity of the character
— is considered and B) Hetcroqrade statisticS, where the
samples are examined regarding the different degrees of in-
tensity of a certain character.

A) Homograde statisticS.

The characters considered, belonging to this part of sta-
tistical problemS, were the number of flower-stalkS, stamenS‚
petals, sepals and leaves in the rosule (at the top of the
stem .

1). Number of Flower-slalks. All the 469 samples were
examined regarding this character. The result of the counts

were:
Number of samples with 1 ssower-stalk 340

Summa 469

Besides one specimen was found having 4 flower-stalkS.
As, however, this specimen was found, occasionally, at an-
other place I have not taken it in consideration in computing
the >)probabilities» for finding a specimen with a certain
number of stalkS. (In other wordS‚ I suppose the probabi-
lity for finding an individual with 4 flower-stalks to be
different from 1 t 470.)

By dividing 469 into 340, 117 and 12 we shall find the
