At the head of each column and row is inscribed the
mid-value of each class in millimeterS. The value of the
coefficient of correlation, computed according to the method
of »Grunddragem p. 84, was

r = -{- O,829 ss 0,036‚

so that a rather strong and well determined correlation exists
between these two characters,

Simultaneously with the coefficient of correlation even
the values of the means and theg dispersions were computed.
As, however, the values of these characteristics were evaluated
from a somewhat more extensive material in ἐξ 7 and 9, it
is not needed to cite here the values obtained. The agree·
ment with those values waS‚ indeed, as good as might be
expected from the mean errors,

17. Correlation between the Zenqth os the slower-stallc and
the Zenqth ο] the lonyest leaf in the rosule. In this respect 139

samples were examined. The result is given in the following
, correlation-table.
