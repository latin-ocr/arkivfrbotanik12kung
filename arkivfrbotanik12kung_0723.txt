Taking into account the values of the mean errors we
find that there is no indication of a correlation between the
number of stamens and the number of flower-stalkS.

3. Number os petala. This number was found to agree
with the corresponding number of stamens‚ in the same

flower‚ with the following exceptionS.

l 56111916 had 8 petals and 7 stamens

1 >2 » 7 >› 2> 6
1 >› 1) 6 1) >› 5
l i> » 6 >) >> 7

Hence the probabilities for finding 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 petals
is, practically, the same as the probabilities for the correspond-
ing number of stamens determined in the preceding ξ.

4. Number os sepaZS. This number agrees with the
corresponding number of petals with the following exceptions

7 samples had 7 petals and 6 sepals
1 » >> 8 » » 6
l >› » 6 » 3> 7

The seven first named cases are, however, uncertain, as
I found — having then already counted some hundred samp-
les — that 2 sepals often hold together giving the appear-
ance of a single sepal. Having taken note of that, I after-
wards did not find any sample with 7 petals and 6 569615.

5. N umber os leaves in the rosule. There were 321 samples
examined in regard to this character, the. result being:

The typical form has 6 leaves in the rosule‚ occurring
in about 50 (Ἀ, of all cases We find, however, that cases
with 5 leaves occur nearly equally often (39 33).

There is a rather strong correlation between the number
of leaves in the rosule and the number of flower·stalks‚ as
will be found from the following table:
