The numerical calculations of the mean and the disper-
sion gave:

Samples with 1 stalle
M = 0111111,768 ;1; 0,(115

0=0 ,183 ὲ 0‚010

σ ; M=0,238.

Samples with 2 stallos
M = Ο111111,907 ss O‚020

0=0 ,176 ss 0,014

σ ; M Ξ Ο,194.

Taking into account the mean errors in the means we
find that there is a prcnounced correlation between the
thickness of the stem and the number of flower-stalks, the
samples with 1 stalk having a thickness (of the stem) of
O¹¹¹¹¹¹‚77‚ those with 2 stalks having a thickness of Ο111111,91. I
leave it undiscussed, if this result shall be declared in such
a manner that the greater thickness favours the generation
of more than one ssower-stalk, 01· that we have two different
types of Trie‘ntalis europaea one with 1 flower and thinner
stem, another with 2 (01· more) flowers and a thicker stem.
