the second and last nuclear division is entered upon. This
is a mitotic reduction-division which shows smaller nuclear
division figures than the former and only 4 double chromo-
somes of which 4 halves travel to each pole (fig. 47—52).
Thus binucleate amoebae again arise (fig. 51) in whose nuclei
the chromatin lies next to the nuclear membrane which has
now again become faintly visible. As regards Plasmodiophora
these amoebac have led PROWAZEK (l. c.) 10 1110 erroneous
conclusion that a nuclear fusion act takes place in this fungus,
The binucleate amoebae now divide into two (fig. 53), which
after having grown larger aggregate, most frequently more
than 30 at a time, and form a loose ball of uninucleate, still
walless spores (fig. 54). These spores are characteIistic in
that their nucleus grows larger before the wall is formed
(fig. 55, 56) and by having, sometimes even after the forma-
tion of the wall, a distinct polar radiation from the side of
the nucleus directed towards the apex or to the basis of the
09010 (fig. 58, 59). The nucleus now by degrees grows smaller
(fig. 57, 61, 60), 01 1001 11 becomes quite tiny‚ and at the
formation of the wall the spores arranged themselves in
double cakes and assumed a characteristic form (see fig. 60,
62, 63) most frequently like a rounded six—cornered closed
urn which at the apex is provided with a ring-formed collar
— as it is also seen, though less plainly, in Sorosphaera Ve-
ronicae (fig. 70). At the full maturity of the Spore-aggregation
the Spore-wall divides into two layers of which the outer
one merges into that of the neighbouring spores, so that it-
gives one the impression of the spores being deposited
in a common substance (fig. 60). This is what SOHWAR'rz25
means when after the setting up of his new Sorosphaera
Junci (now he proposes the genus-diagnosis altered into:
