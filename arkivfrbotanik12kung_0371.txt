WINGE, CYTOLOG. STUDIES IN THE PLASMODIOPHORACEAE. ῙῘ

As regards the habit of the infection it must be men-
tioned that tubers are formed on the host-plant of up to
7 >< 3 mm. in diameter (as a rule, however, smaller). These
tubers are most often globular and occur as well on the
primary axis as more especially, on the secondary oneS, which
are often by the fungus converted into globular formations
attaining the size of a couple of mm. (fig. 9 and 10). The
spores are formed in cakes consisting of two layers (fig. 63)
inside the stalks, only epidermis and the outermost cortica]
tissue are not infected. The normally centrally placed vas-
cular bundles are displaced and lie scattered about in the
deformed stall( —— or they are totally destroyed. In case.
the inner cortical cells contain the fungus they groW to an
abnormal size — up to 150 μ. in diam. and then — as a rule
— at the maturity of the fungus they contain more than
lO Spore-aggregations. In a single host-cell may at the same
time be found young myxamoebae and fully mature spore-
aggregationS. The Spore-places vary greatly in size, they may
contain over 200 spores consequently 100 in each layer and
in such case they att-ain a size of up to 65 >< 45 μ. The
nucleus of an infected cell of Callitriche is often very like a
young amoeba of Sorodz'scus (fig. 64).

The similarity between Sorodiscus and Sorosphaera is as
formerly mentioned great, so great in fact, that it would
seem most reasonable to unite them into one genuS. As,
however, the position of the spores at the maturity are con·
sidered of great importance for the definition of the genera
of this family we shall adopt LAGERHEIM’s »nomen nudum»
Sorodiscm, since the sporeS, as mentioned above, ¹arrange
themselves in spore·cakes two layers thick, or one might
say — perfectly flattened hollow spheres or hollow ellipsoidS.
Only occasionally a small lumen may be seen between the
two layers of spores, and but rarely the spore-aggregations
assume the form of a hollow sphere.

The Cytology of SorodiscuS.

As regards this species we are unfortunately unable to*
state „- as is also the case with Sorosphaera Veronicae —
how the host-plant becomes infected and we are likewise
