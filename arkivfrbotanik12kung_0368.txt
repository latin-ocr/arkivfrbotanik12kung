chromatin presumably travels to the periphery through radi-
ating linin·filaments. This is in 'perfect accordance with my
investigationS.

It is presumably due to the description by NAwAscHIN
and PROWAZEK of the total disappearance of the nuclei that
the concept is still in existence that the nuclei are resolved,
and that eventually fresh ones are formed. — As regards·
Sponqospora a similar solution of the nuclei has lately been
described (OSBORN24). .

As regards the form of the mature speres it must be
remarkedthat they are furnished with a collar-formed swel-
ling of the apex (see fig. -—). This has not been mentioned
by the named authors.

Ligniera Junci (SOHWARTZ) MAIRE et Tison.

In the year 1910 SCHwARTz25 found a Pla-smodiophoracea
on roots of Juncus busoniuS, J. articulatus and J. lampre-
carpus„ and he shortly treats its biology, which is interesting
in this respect that in several ways it differs from Sorosphaera
Verom'cae. He points out that the infection of the host-plant
takes place in this way that an amoeba penetrates into a
root-hair and from there travels to the root itself, dividing
on the road. He does not, however, treat this travelling in
greater detail. From his description and illustrations we,
however, come to the conclusion that the amoebae are really
able to penetrate through the cell-walls which they meet on
their way. Another characteristic is, that the fungus does
not produce hypertrophy or formation of gigantic cells like
Sorosphaera Veronicae and Plasmodz’ophora Brassicae. On the
contrary we do not observe any unusual features in macro-
scopical respect in the infected plantS. The infected cells
keep their normal seize and normal nucleus The spore-
aggregations of this species are often not at all spherical,
and SOHWARTZ is of opinion that the reason hereof iS, that
the cells do not become hypertrophied3 in the small cortical
cells of the root there is no room for the large hollow sphercS‚
hence the spores are forced to arrange themselves in indif-
ferent congregations. — It may, however, be questionable
whether the space-conditions are indeed the real manse». —-
