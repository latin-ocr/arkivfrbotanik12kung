8. Draba alpina L.

D. alpina has always been a distinct species in Scandi-
navia, differing as it is from all other species by its pure
yellow colour. LINNAEUS had himself discovered this species
during his tour in Lappony 1732. In the Flora Lapponica
(1737) p. 211 he calls it Draba scapo nudo simplici, soliis lan-
ceolatis zfnteqerrimis. That D. alpina which is mentioned in
that passage as cultivated in the Botanical garden of Leyden
is not, however, our Northern plant but, according to J. E.
SMITH (Risui-TER: Caroli Linnaei Systema p. 625), Draba ciliaris
L. As D. cilia-ris is described by LINNAEUS (Mantissa ed. 1
1767 p. 91) as having white flowerS, it seems to me as if it
must rather be Draba azoz‘des L.

Our form of D. alpina is not found in the Alps, but
only a form affined to it: Draba Sauterz' ΗΟΡΡΕ (l. c. p. 425)
KooH: Synopsis Florae Germanicae ed. 3 (1857) p. 543 REI-
CHENBACH: Icones Florae Germanicae n:o 4252.

CELsms had given the name of D. alpina hirsuta to D.
incana L. (Flora Lapponica p. 211) and L1NNAEUs himself calls
this plant D. alpina in his »Vastgota Besa» 1747 p. 74.

D. alpina L. hybridiges in the North, both with D.
sladm‘zensis and D. mayellanica.

In Aret-ic stations still more intermediate forms are
found, which renders the limitation of the species there more
difficult.

The covering of the leaves of D. alpina consists gene-
rally of long cilia (of the lenght of about 1 mm.) and on
the surface of stellulate hairs. Thus it is represented in
Svensk Botanik tom. ll f. 771, and in L. REIOHENBACH’S
Plantae Criticae tab. 772 n:o 1036—38. In the hybrid between
D. sladnz'zensis and D. alpina the pubescence also on the
surface of the leaf generally consists mainly of simple hairs
and the flowers are of a pale yellow colour. Sometimes, how-
ever, simple hairs are also found on the surface of the
leaves of specimens with typical bright yellow flowerS. With
such a covering of simple hairs on the surface the plant is

g For the present 1 do not venture decide whether this
latter form is a hybridous one or not.
