as ‘to the pubescence, which, as far as I know, is only found
in hybrids or intermediate forms. It is not only a different
covering on the leaves 01 the outer and the inner ranges of
the rosella — this is nothing atypical in some species 01 the
genus Draba — but one leaf is unlike the other 1166163111,
and the cilia, which should constitute a characteristic, are
often entirely missing or only found imperfect on the inner
leaves, This form is mostly found in the North 01 Scandi-
navia as the Norvegian Nordlanden and Finnmarken and
the Swedish Lapp-territories of Pite and Lule, where, on the
other hand, the true D. jladnizensis is rare. The opinion
which LANGE pronounces l. 6. p. 40 and 41 shows that
this heterotrichous form in Greenland is very common.

In consequence 01 the above considerations, it seems to
me the name 01 this form should be Draba lapponica WG„
not Draba sladnizensis j. lapponica,· -— 11 it is not to be
designated: Draba jladnizensis —— rupestis.

There are again in Scandinavia two forms 01 D. Wahlen-
berqii f. homolricha. The one, which We might call j. qenuina,
has only cilia or simple hairs in the margin 01 the leaves„
By this character it corresponds also with the above men-
tioned specimens from the neighbourhood 01 Fladnitz and
with the illustration 01 v. WULFEN l. c. The other form has
both simple hairs in the margins and on the surface 01 the
leaveS, Draba lactea ADAMsi (Memoires des Nat. de Moscou
V (1817) p. 104—-105 and Icones Plant. Flor. Ross. tab. 200).
On the separate representation 01 the leaves some hairs are
found on the surface‚ and in ADAMS’ description the leaves
are said to be: »supra jere qlabroe subtus et ad marqinem pilis
simplicibus hispida». Ought also this form to be called D.
sladnizensis WULF. or is it to be regarded as an intermediate
form between this species and another one, 01· Draba alpina
L? It is true that such forms sometimes occur. I have
seen a great number of them, particularly from the shores
of the Arctic Ocean (collected in 1911 by the Rev. S. J.
ENANDER) where also J. M. F. ADAMs has gathered his D.
lactea. Buth these specimens 01 Mr ENANDER have all some
branched hairs, mixed with the more abundant simple ones,
and the style is somewhat longer. I am therefore inclined
to consider D. lactea and its corresponding Scandinavian
form 01 D. Wahlenberyii as a Northern subalpine form 01
