really found in Sponqospora, we should rather conclude,
that- this organism is 11013 6 Plasmodiophoracea.

Tetramyxa parasitica GOEBEL.55

About this fungus we shall only state that we have
studied 13116 cytology of 113 and that we have seen the. 1110313
part of 13116 figures characteristic for the other Plasmodio-
plioraceae (fig. 71—78). In 1910 MAIRE and TJSON23 have
shown, 111613 Tetramyxa parasitica was really a Plasmodio-
phoracea.

An other 31160163 of Tetramyxa, T. Triylochim‘s MOLL.56
13 according 130 MAIRE and Tiso>130 devoid of sporeS,·and for
this reason t-hey have classed 113 63 6 new genus: Molliardia.
113 1111131ι be left 130 13116 fubure to decide, whether T. Triqlo-
chinis is really devoid of sporeS.

The relationship of the Plasmodiophoraceae with 13116
holocarpic Chytridiaceae 13 beyond doubt. Several species
have by degrees been pointed 01113 which occupy an inter—

mediary position —— even though 1110313 of 13116111 are still in-
sufficiently examined —- especially from a cytological poinb
of view.

Such are evidently:

Chrysophlyctis endobiotica SCHILBERSZKY, de-
scribed in 1896 from Hungary45 63 found on potatoeS. In
1909 JACOB ERIKSSON‘ffi mentioned this fungus. It has been
found in several countrieS, Hungary, Engiand (many
places), Scobland, Rhenish Prussia, near Arnsberg in
VVest-phalia and in Ireland. ERIKSSON states 1311613 13116
fungus 13 devoid of mycelium, but 11161311 propagates by
large, tawny zoosporangia (1-—3 in each cell) in which are
found a very grear number of zoosporeS. Moreover 13116
fungus has polygonal resting—spore8‚ one in each cell. Cysts
are unknown. — It. 1311113 3661113 130 bc more closely-related 130

spores, 111113 no cystS.
