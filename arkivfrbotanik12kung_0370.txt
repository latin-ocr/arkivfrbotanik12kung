and compared them to those of the Urticaceae‚ but ROSA-
NOFF is of opinion that they are the remains of a parasitic
mycelium. These were all the results arrived at by the two
authors

The next time we find this fungus mentioned in the
literature is in 1907 in »Botanisk Tidskrift». On an excur-
sion the fungus was found (on Sept. l5th) by Dr. O. H. OS-
TENFELD on callitriche autumnalis in the small stream near
Bonnekro and in the lake Ringsjo', both places in the
neighbourhood of Sjoholm station (Skane, Sweden) and was
set down (l. c.) as a new myxomycet‚ Sorodz'scus Gallitrz‘chis
which LAGERHEIM proposed to describe later on under this
designation. —- LAGERHfflM was namely perfectly well ac-
quainted with this fungus long before 1907 as in the year 1893
he had already found it on Callitrz'cke vernalis growing on
most soil near Bjerkeng in Malselvdalen (the valley of
the Mais-river) in the county of Tromso, Norway, and 7
years later (1900) 116 had collected material of it in the same
place. He only found a few infected plantS‚ but material
from these were fixed with ›>Merkel» and LAGERHEIM got so
far in his investigat-icus of the fungus that he took a· number
of cuts on the microtome which convinced him, that Soro-
dz'scus was a new endophytic mycetOZO.

Finally the fungus is mentioned in a third place, as
MAIRE and TISON in their latest published work30 cite the
above mentioned memoir by KARELTOHIKoFF and ROSANOFF.
They write: ›>. ..KARELTCHIKOFF et ROSANOFF (1870) ont
decrit des tumeurs produites sur Callitriche autumnalis L.
par un organisme qui, d’apres leur description, pourrait bien
etre une Plasmodiophoracee.» - This assumption was pre—
sumably essentially confirmed during a visit which these
authors paid to Professor LAGERHEIM in Stockholm a few
years ago,

The result of my observations on the fungus for the
most part agree with the conditions in Sorosphaera Veronicae‚
yet with the modifications stated above. After LAGERHEIM
had cut up the material into cuts of 2—7 μ it was stained
with Safranin-Gentianviolet-Orange, Fuchsin-Toluidinblue and
Ironalun-Haematoxylin, of which methods the first named
proved most successful.
