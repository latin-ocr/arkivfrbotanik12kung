All these measures were performed at the end of the
period, when the anthers had already begun to shrink. From
this reason the above values of the characteristics must be
considered much more uncertain than is indicated by the
value of the mean errore.

13. Pollen. The diameter of the pollen was microscopi-
cally determined for 24 sampleS. Ι was astonished to find
pollengrains of two different kinds, one having a diameter
of about Omm,02‚ the other a diameter of Omm,04, or twice as
large as the other. The material was too small for the sett-
ling of a correlation with other characters of the flower, but
I suppose that the question may be easily accounted for by
botanists of profession.

Calling the smaller pollengrains P I and the larger ones
P ΙΙ, the values obtained were:
