as they have nuclei, and every portion by and by is rounding
off representing a young spore.

NAwAsoflrN’s only essential mistake, as it has later on
been pointed out by PRowAZEK (l. c.) is that in reality two
mitotical divisions take place instead of a single one. After
the description of PROWAZEK‚ however, also a caryogamy is
found in the myxamoebae before the completed formation of
spores — as is the case with the myxomycetes — and further
he is of opinion that one of the two fusing-nuclei even before
this final fusion in the young spore undertakes a division
connected with chromosome-reduction‚ while the other onc
persists undivided. His figures of these phenomena carry but
little conviction. In connection with this presumed fusion
he explains also two types of nuclei in the late vegetative
(amoeba-)phase of Plasmodwphora, the first type having the
chromatin split into small bits5 which are conglomerated in
eight chromatin bodies, the other retaining for a while a
nucleolus and having the chromatin distributed into strings
and garlandS, which by and by are moved out to the peri-
phery of the nucleUS‚ whereupon the nucleolus disappearS.
The number of chains he states to be eight, at- least some
times, PROWAZEK explains that »Die beiden Typen von
Kernveranderungen diirften auf geschlechtliche Differenzie-
rungen zuriickzufiihren sein». — We may add, that these types
—— especially the garland-type -— may also often be seen in
other Plasmodiophoraceae‚ they being but two of manyfold
variations of distribution of the chromatin at this stage.

Another observation of PRowAZEK that a subsequent
radiation of chromatin into the protoplasma thereupon takes
place, an observation‚ which he compares wit-h the conditions
as they are described for the Mycoplasma-nuclei (ERIKSSON
a. ο.) and according to which the nuclei are finally entirely
resolved, whereupon new ›>Geschlechtskerne›> are formed, is
judging from my own observations on other Plasmodiophora-
ceae not correct. It is true that the chromatin grew less
conspicuous and a partial radiation to the plasma cannot be
absolutely denied‚ but the vegetative nuclei never disappear
entirely; at- all events the cavity of the nucleus can always
be discerned (hereon later).

In 1909 the above named treatise by MAIRE and TISON
was published‚ in which they shortly treat the cytology of
