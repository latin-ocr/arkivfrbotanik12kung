unable to state with certainty whether amoebae which have
only a single nucleus are primary amoebae or have come into
existence as meronts by devision of schizontS. Statements
and figures in ΜΑΙΒΕ and TISON5 of uninucleate and bi-
nucleate amoebae in Sorosphaera are- presumably correct,
but such amoebae with apparently few nuclei are often
got by cutting off parts of a multinucleate amoeba. As,
however, the authors named state, that they have observed
a great quantity of uninucleate amoebae situated one or a
few together in each cell, we are led to the conclusion that
this is really the case, and that the amoebae are either able
to penetrate the cell-waIIS, so that the infection may have
spread in this way, or that the host-plant is infected while
still very young, and that the infection-amoeba at first un·
dergoes very frequent divisionS, possibly d ivisions simultaneous
with the nuclear divisions, and that the parasite is distri-
buted solely by cell-divisions of thc host-plant, and thus only
to daughter-cells originating from an originally infected cell.
It must be left to the future to decide which is the correct·
assumption, but a priori it seems to me probable that the
young amoebae are able to penetrate cell-walls as well as
many, more animal-like, protozoa. W'hat moreover leads us
to this conclusion, nay, what even seems a sufficient proof,
is, that often in tubers of Sorosphaera or Sorodiscus which
must be considered as originating from one infection, one
may find cells which are so distantly related, that the infec-
tion of a cell in the seedling would not be sufficient to ex-
plain the distribution. Both in Veronica and Callitrichc it
is mainly the inner cortex and parts of the central cylinder
which contain sporeS, so that not even an infection of the
germ might result in so extensive an infestation if the fungus
did not spread actively. Liyniera Junci likewise seems to
imply the wall-penetrating power of the myxamoebae‚ and
statements about the capability of the Liqniera 9raminis-
amoebae of sending pseudopodia right through the cell-walls
(SoHWARTz‘2ss) as also the conditions in Pyrrhosorus marinus
JUEL31 (see later onl) seem to confirm this assumption.

The youngest stages of Sorodiscus which I have succeeded
in invcstigating are the amoeba-stage at a more advanced
stage, as I have only examined infections which have spread
a good deal, but never primarily infected cellsi. By such
