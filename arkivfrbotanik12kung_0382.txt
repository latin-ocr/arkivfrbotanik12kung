myxoplasms with one small nucleus are seen in the cells of
the alga which must be assumed to have been formed by
swarming-spores which forced their way in recently. Several
such small plasms may be found together in one cell, and
JUEL considers it. possible that later on they fuse into a
fusion-plasmodium. Moreover he finds both small myxo-
plasms with one larger nucleus and larger myxoplasms with
several nuclei. The former he accounts for in this way that
the nuclei in the above mentioned uninucleate cells have
grown in size. (Probably they are meronts!) The latter have
either arisen by fusion of the uninucleated ones or by nuclear
divisions having taken place and the nuclei having grown in
size. This last hypothesis is, judging from the hitherto known
Plasmodiophoraceae, the correct one.

JUEL has likewise examined myxoplasms with many small
nuclei and he is of opinion, that possibly they arise in this
way that the large nuclei in the plurinucleate amoebae suc-
cessively divide into smaller 01166. —- In case these are not
just young 01166, plurinucleate a-moebae representing t-he first-
schizont—generationS. which, however, the want of caryosome
in the nucleus in the illustration seems to deny, then JUEL’s
view is correct. The nuclei of this stage are, however, ac-
cording to his figures, remarkably small. —

About the next stage be remarks that: »Das Plasmodium
ist in eine grosse Anzahl von amoben-ahnlichen Korpern mit
je einem Zellkern aufgeteilt. Die Umrisse dieser Zellkorper
sind im Praparate recht- undeutlich» . .. These »plasmodiw
evidently represent the last phase of the »chromatical stage»
of the true Plasmodiophoraceae. — The myxoplasms surround
themselves with a wall, and inside this are either formed
closely placed spindle-formed uninucleate small cells which
quickly become rounded spore-mother cells — or scattered
spindle-formed cells which probably also later on —in some
cases certainly — are converted into Spore-mother cells, These
walled plasms with scattered nuclei frequently stretch in a

net-like way through a greater number of the cells of the ’

host-plant, so that the plasma before it became walled must
have penetrated a great number of the cell-walls.

The closely placed, uninucleate and walless Spore-mother
calls are often intermingled with a few sterile cells which go
to ruin. The nuclei and the Spore-mother cells now divide
