l. c. is given: ›>D. stylaris GAY ined. in herbarium GAUD1N»).
Under the name 01 D. stylaris J. D. KoeH has described the
same plant in Syn. Fl. Germ. ed. 2 1843 p. 70. In the 3d
ed. of this work (1857) p. 57, he gives it the name of Draba
Thomasii ΚΟΟΗ, 111 honour of the above mentioned E.
THOMAS, who had been the first to discover it in Switzerland.

In Scandinavia the name of D. confusa occurs in t-he 3d
ed. of HAR'rMAn’s Skand. Flora 1838 p. 153 as a designation
for the plant which HARTMAN in the 2nd edition 1832 p. 178
has called D. imane—hirta (Ξ D. mayellanica)‚ which name
appears again in his 4th edition 1843 p. 210. Moreover‚ the
name 01 D. confusa often occurs in collections for D. mayel-
lanica.

The Draba confusa of Central Europe — or to eall the
plant by its right name — D. styralis (GAY) KOOH —is affi-
ned both to D. mayellanica and D. incana, though well distin-
guished from both.

In collections I have also seen it from the Altai district;
but it does not occur in the North.

I have endeavoured here to pass briefly in review the
various nomenclatores for the commonest alpine varieties of
the genus Draba. Provided. time and strength be vouchsafed
me, it wil] be a great pleasure to me to return once more
to this genus in order to subject to a fuller treatment the
many varieties of the D. rchestris group, as well as a few
sub-species of Draba mayellareica.

 

Ere Ι lay down my pen, it is my pleasant duty to ex-
press my most cordial thanks to those who in various ways
have assisted me in this interesting study of the genus Draba,·
first and foremost to Professor C. LINDMAN of Stockholm;
