WINGE, CYTOLOG. STUDIES IN THE PLASMODIOPHORACEAE. 31.

Τ116 designations employed by the various authors for
the organs of the Plasmodiophoraceae and their relations are
often varying. Especially disagreeing are the opinions asto
whether it is allowable to say, that a ›>spore» at the germina-
tion may be converted into a ›>sporangium›> since the contents
of the ›>spore›> forms several zoospores. It is likewise evident
how difficult it is to keep apart the definitions ›>spore-mother
cell» and »sporangium›>. The aggregations of spore-mother
cells in one form are plainly perfectly homologous with the
sorosporangia in another. -— As regards this matter it must
be remarked‚ that as the definition »spore›> is very elastic‚
we can scarcely be wrong in using the denotation ›>spores»
in the Plasmodiophoraceae even though these at the germi-
nation prove themselves capable of further divisionS, thus
reminding us of yet indifferentiated sporangia. When we
compare the conditions in the Plasmodiophoraceae with Sor-
olpidium and Pyrrhosorus it becomes moreover quite evident
that the myxamoebac in the former, form Spore-mother ceIIS‚
where in the latter they form ›>sorosporangia» — (since the
Spore-mother cells are here formed within a wall). The cir-
cumstance that the Spore-mother cells within the wall of the
›>sporangium» are outdifferentiated seems to favour the
belief that a reductive division takes place at the spore-
formation like in the Plasmophoraceae and all the higher
plants where Spore-mother cells are formed in the sporangia
(micro- and macro-sporangia). It is thus the entire amoeba
which after having become walled may be termed sporan-
gium —- not the Spore—mother cells as Nimmc has it. A re-
ductive division in Sorolpidium cannot be expected to be
found prior to the aggregational stage, but at the formation
of the zoospores. In case NEMEo's strange theory should be
carried out that the spores of the true Plasmodiophoraceae
are unispored sporangia, the curious fact would arise that
sporangia are formed in these as a result of the reductive
division at the formation of tetrades. We can, therefore, not
agree with his declaration that his theoriesr are ›>M‹·5glich-
keiten ...... die psychologisch wohl zu erklaren sind».

The conditions in Sorolpz‘dium and Pyrrh-osorus may on
the whole be paralleled with the microsporangia of the phane-
rogams in which Spore-mother cells are formed which again
form spores, If a reductive division also proves to appear
