WINGE, CYTOLOG. STUDIEs ΙΝ THE PLASMODIOPHORACEAE. 27

Rhizomyxa hypogaea ΒοΒΖΙπῑΞ In this species which
is somewhat closer related to the Plasmodiophoraceae‚ the
naked plasma situated in the host-cell changes directly into
a sporosorus, as the rather large speres at the maturity set
free 1—:2‚ rarely a greater number of uniciliate zoospores

By a direct transformation of the whole plasma resting-
cysts are, however, sometimes formed consisting of numerous,
close lying small resting-spores which at the germination are
converted into as many small zoosporangia. The possibility
is moreover not precluded that- this species like the two
first named, may form large ephemeral zoosporangia.

WOronina DOlyCyStiS CORNU49 is evidently-closely
related to le'zomyxa, as the naked plasma in this species is
likewise converted either into a sporosorus in which the
spores at maturity send out several swarming-spores or into
almost globular, brownish resting-cysts formed by many small,
close lying spores which at the germination send out swarming-
spores of the same appearance as those which originate from
the above named larger spores. The zoospores are biciliate
as they have one lateral and one apica] cilia.

Pyrrhosorus marinus JUEL.31

This fungus is plainly very closely related to the Plas-
modiaphoraceae. -JUEL found it growing on dead branches
of Cystoclonium purpurascens which he had cultivated in
his laboratorium. He examined the fungus as well in live
condition as after he had fixed it and cut it on the micro-
tome. He gives (l. e.) a detailed and excellent description
of the developmental cycle of the fungus which is of
special interest, 33 it· seems to throw some light on the
Plasmadiophoraceae. First shall be mentioned that JUEL
considers himself justified in stat-ing that the fungus is not
a parasite, but a saprophyte‚ for he only found it an dead
branches and sometimes placed on the surfaceffl) of the alga.
There is, however, scarcely any doubt that Pyrrhosorus like
its nearest relations is parasitic —— at least during part of
its life. It also seems to me that JUEL’s figures of the inter-
cellular growth of the fungus point in this direction. -— He
finds the life-cycle of t-he fungus to be as follows Small
