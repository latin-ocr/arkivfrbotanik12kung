These numbers give:

M =0‚291 ss 0‚017

σ = O‚045 ὲ 0‚01<2
σ : M = O‚16.

Both measures were performed with the oeular—miero-
meter.

C) Correlation. I have examined above some cases of
correlation belonging to the dominion of homograde stati-
sties, as the correlation between the number of flower·stalks
and the number of leaves in the rosule, the correlation
between the thickness of the stem and the number of flower-
stalks and other similar questions In those cases it was
stated that a correlation between two characters did exist,
but no numerica-l measure of the de9ree of that correlation
was given. It is, indeed, not impossible to find such mea-
sureS‚ but either are they in many cases somewhat arbitrarily
chosen or, in otherS, mathematioally more intricate to eal·
eulate and I have left them here out of consideration, con-
fining me to such elementary methods as are given in the
›>Grunddragen›>.

In heterograde statisties such a measure of the degree
of correlation between two characters is well defined and
easy to calculate numerieally. It is the so called coejsz‘cient
os correlation (r). I give beneath the value of this coeffieient
for 5 pairs of characters of Trientalis europaea.

15. Correlation between the lenyth os the stamen (s) and
the Zenqth os the pistil (p). There were only 13 simultaneous
values of s and p.
