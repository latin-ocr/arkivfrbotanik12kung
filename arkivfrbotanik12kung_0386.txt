in Sorolpz'dz'um and Pyrrhosorus at the formation of the zoo-
sporeS, the resemblance with the Plasmodiophoraceae becomes
still more conspicuous. — The contents of the sporangia (the
walled amoebae) in one form and a collection of spore-mother
cells in another must surely be considered homologous;
whether a surrounding wall is formed or not must be con-
sidered of minor importance -— and whether it by the divi-
sions enters the daughter-cells, ,

Closer cytological investigations of Crywphlychs, Astero-
cystc‘3‚ Rhizomyrz and Woronma will probably prove that
Δ these forms have much in common with Pyrrho-sorus, How
much, we are not yet able to determine.

As regards the Plasmodiophoraceae it would be of great
interest to ascertain how the germination of the spore takes
place. We are of opinion that it must bc assumed that
swarming-spores are formed which copulate and produce a
small myxoplasma which actively penetrates the epidermal
cells of the host-plant — both as regards the parasitic species
