ΤΟ say the least of it, this is to turn facts upside down.
NEMEC seems totally to forget that »the sorosporangia» (the
spores) in the Plasmodiophoraceae are not formed until after
the two sporogonic divisions have taken place, while in So-
rolpz'clz'um and Pyrrhosorus they are formed prior to these
divisionS. In Sorolpiclz'um the sporogonic divisions do not
take place until after this cell-amassment which NfiMEe affects
calling »Sorosporangienh'aufen». .— lt is thus not justifiable
to homologize these stages It will be seen from the follow-
ing classification that the ›>cysts» occurring in the Plasmo-
diophoraceae are aggregations of sporeS‚ while in Pyrrhosorns
and Sorolpidium they are aggregations of walled Spore—mother
cells

From Nimfflc’s more detailed, but somewhat slovenly paper
(1. e.) it is evident„ that his Sorolpidium is closely related to
Pyrrhosorzcs and the Plasmodiophoraceae. It is remarkable
that Ninfflc without any reservation terms the vegetative
divisions of this fungus »karyokinetische›>. It can not be
justifiable to term nuclear divisions which are characteristic
by the want of visible chromosomes and by the amitose—like
bipartition of the nucleolus (the caryosome) mitotical. NizMEO
says: »Es lasst sich nichts ausfindig machen‚ was dartun
konnte, das der Nucleolus Material zur Bildung von Chro-
mosomen abg'abe.» There is, however, hardly any doubt that,
by closer investigationS, Sorolpz‘dz'um in this as in every other
respect will be found to resemble the Plasmodiophoracae.
Alone the circumstance that chromosomes and caryosomes
never occur simultaneously points in this direction. — Another
of Nfimc’s observations is unintelligible to us: »Plasmoclio-
phora bildet keine Membran um ihren vegetativen Korper‚
wenn sie sich zur Fortpflanzung anschickt. Die mit Plasmo·
diophora sicher verwandte Sorosphaera bildet jedoch eine
Membran.» Sorosphoera Veronz'cae‚ at any rate, does not
form any membrane but on the sporeS, and it must be due
to a misunderstanding when NisMEc is of opinion that other
species do so, It deserves notice that Sorolpidium Betae does
not produce hypertrophy in the host-plant, radiat-ive pheno-
mena from the poles of the nuclei are not observed‚ but in
the apices of the nuclear spindle are seen distinct centrioles
which NEMEC explains as swellings of the ›>Cellemembran›>.
