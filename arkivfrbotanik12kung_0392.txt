Fig. 21. Big nucleus from a later amoeba-generation‚ apparently

showing chromosomes. (See also fig. 19.)

v 22—29. A series of nuclei at different stages of division. In
25 the connecting membrane (as in fig. 18) can be seen.

> 30. Two daughter-nuclei (from a later division) showing a sort
of centrodesmose.

Χ> 31—39. Chromatical phase of the fungus' life-cyclus.

> 31—-35,

The chromatii] leaving the caryosome going to the

periphery.

> 36—37. The chromatin probably going partly out in the sur- ⁵
rounding protoplasm. »Ga1·lands» are seen at the two poles,
These are connected with strings.

> 38—39. The chromatin going to form a central plate for the
following division.

> 40—-41, Spore-mother-cells. Side· and vertical view of the
metakinetic plate from the first sporogonic division.

> 42 and 44 (plate Ill). Later stage of the same division.

intranuclear spindle.

» 48. All the nuclei dividing simultaneous1y3 second division.

> 50. Later stage. — Zeiss hom. Imm. 2 mm, Komp.-oc. 18.

> 51. Plasms with two nuclei, resulting from the last division. —
Zeiss hom. Imm. 2 mm.. Komp.—oc. 18.

> 52. Sta-ge between 50 and 51. Reconstruction of the daughter-
nuclei. — Zeiss hom. Imm. 2 mm„ Komp.-oc. 18.

> 53. Uni-nucleate small plasms (young spores)‚ the binucleate
plasms (in fig. 51) having been divided into two. — Zeiss
hom. Imm. 2 mm.⁷ Komp.-oc. 18.

» 54.

The young spores and their nuclei are increased and are
forming a spore-cake.
> 55—56. More advanced stages. The nuclei are very large.

> 57. Formation of a wall around the sporeS. The nuclei getting
smaller.

> 58—59. Young sporeS. The polar radiation may be seen.
> 60. A spore at the maturity. The wall has been differentiated

into two layers, the outer one merges into that of the neigh-
bouring spores.
