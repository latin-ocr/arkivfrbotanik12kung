The values of the thickness was also evaluated with the
help of the ocular-mikrometer.

9. Leaves in the rosule. These were examined regarding
a) the length of the longest leaf in the rosule, b) regarding
the length of each leaf in the rosule‚ examining separa-
tely samples with 5 and with 6 leaveS‚ c) regarding the
length and the breadth of the leaveS‚ and d) regarding the
correlation between the length and the breadth of the longest
leaf. The last-named investigation shall be given beneath
together with other questions on the correlation between
different characters

a) The length of the longest leaf was found to be in-
timately connected with the number of leaves in the rosule.
The more numerous the leaves in the rosule are the longer
is the longest leaf. I give therefore here seperately the re-
sult for samples with 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 leaves in the rosule.
