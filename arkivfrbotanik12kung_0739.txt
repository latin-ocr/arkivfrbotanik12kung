A gia-nce on these values shows that the length of the
stamen is generally increasing with that of the pisti]⁷ that
hence a correlation between these characters does exist.
Using the methods of ›>Grunddragen›> p. 78 —wbich refers to
such caseS, where the number of pairs is so small that a
distribution into classes is not appropriate — we find for the
coefficient of correlation the value:

r = 4.— 0‚527 ss O‚236.

The value obtained is, consequently‚ rather uncertain
owing to the small number of observations.

We have found in ξ 12 and ξ 14 that the mean length
of the stamen is 4‚47 (ss O,16) and that of the pistil 4‚36
(ss O‚12). Within the mean errors we thus ean consider the
mean length of the stamen to be identical to that of the
pistil. The value given above for the coefficient of corre-
lation permits usto state that, even for other than the
mean-values, the length of the stamen, to α certain deqree,
follows that of the pistil. I allow myself to express the
opinion that a general investigation on the correlation be-
tween those characters for flowering plants seems to me to
be not without biological interest.
