EKMAN, NOMENCLATURE OF SOME NORTH-EUROPEAN DRABAE. 13

Central Europa (Flore Franqaise ed. 3 (1815) t. IV p. 699),
which plant, as far as I can judge‚ must be D. corinthiaco
ΗΟΡΡΕ or a form very closely allied to it.

7. Draba. crassifolia GRAHAM.

This species established by GRAHAM (in Edinburgh New
Philosophical Journal 7 1829 p. 182) is said to have been
found for the first time in Norway in 1837 by L. L. LAE-
STADIUS on Mount Tsatsa near Lyngen-Fjord (HART31AN l. e.
ed. 11 p. 208). Further it has been collected by J. M. NORMAN
on the Floifjeld near Tromso (J. M. NORMAN: »Index Supp-
lementarius» in Det Norske Videnskabers Selskabs Skrifter,
5 bind.‚ 1 hest. 1865 p. 5). In Sweden the plant has never
been gathered.

Both GRAHAM and J. W. HOOKER (l. c. p. 54) distin-
guished two forms of it, viz, one with yellow and another
with white flowerS. With yellow flowerS, of the same colour
as D. alpina, it is represented in Flora Danica tab. 2419.
The Norwegian individuals Ι have seen in collections had
creamy white or pale sulphureus-coloured flowers, as in
dried specimens of D. jladnizensz‘s or D. mayellam‘ca. (Ac-
cording to BLYTT l. c. p. 981 they are also of a pale yellow
when in a fresh state.) The character derived from the less
prominent midrib on the under side of the leaves will not
always serve as a criterium in distinguishing the two species
from each other, as this prominent midrib is also missing in
specimens of D. sladnizensis f. i. from localities where the
snow is just melting. A character which, as far as I have
seen, is alway constant in D. crassisolia is the longer, oblong
pods, On the illustration in Flora Danica l. c. there are
some granulate ridges in the seed. These are, however, miss-
ing in the seeds of an individual with white flowers (ga-
thered by Mr A. LANDMARK on the Flojfjeld) which is in the
Museum at Stockholm. The seeds of this specimen are quite
smooth like those of D. sladnizensis. If the form with white
flowers also belongs to this specieS‚ D. crasszssjolsia would
