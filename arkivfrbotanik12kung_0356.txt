on his part toward me. I am also indebted to my friend,
the cytologist Professor O, ROSENBERG for much good advice
and for persona] kindness during my sojourn at the Univer-
sity of Stookholm. A Journey in foreign countries robbed
me of the best part of the year 1911, 50 11131 only now I
have had leisure to collect my results into this paper.

If not 311 excellent 11631156 by Rmussz MAIRE and ADmAN
TISON: La Cytologie des Plasmodiophorace'es et 13 613556 cles
Phytomyxinae (Annales Μ576. 1909) and several other papers
on the Plasmodiophoraeeae by the same authorS, by BLOM-
FIELD and SCHWARTZ a. 0. had been published in the mean-
time, the reeords of LAGERHfflM would have been of greater
moment. [n order to avoid repetitions we shall now only
report his investigations on the teratology of the species of
Veronica, when they 316 infeoted by Sorosphaera Verom'cae,
and we are also going to publish a new genus of the family
of the Plasmodiophoraoeae together with some critical remarks
on 011161 forms.

Plasmodiophora Brassieae WOR.

After the monography by Wosso-xmss on this fungus se-
veral other authors have undertaken investigations of it
(among which EYCLESHYMER‚¹ ΨΑΚΚΕΒ,2 NAWASCHIN,3 PRo-
WAZEK,4 MAIRE and TISON5).

NAWASCHIN gave the impulse to the study of the 65710-
logy of Plasmodiophora, and his 16511115, which 316 put down
in his above-named excellent paper‚ give almost exaetly the
true figure of the oytology of all fungi, belonging to the
Plasmodiophoraoeae. NAWAsoHIN points out that plurinuc-
leated 3111061136 with 1166111131 111161631 divisions are found in
the host-plant; these divide into smaller ones, and by divisions
of the host-plant the 3111061136 316 spread in the 11551165.
After further divisions of the nuclei and the amoebae
(the two kinds of division, however, take place independ-
ently of each other) these latter ones change their nature
shortly before the spore-forma-tion in that· their nucleoli,
which were hitherto very conspicuouS, entirely disappear.
Still new nucleoli will be formed and a common mitosis is
going on3 finally the amoebae are divided into 35 11131157 partS,
