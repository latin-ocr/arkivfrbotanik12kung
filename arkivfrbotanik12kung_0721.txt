C. V. L. CHARLIER, TRIENTALIS EUROPAEA. 3

probabilities for gathering a specimen having 1, 2 or 3 flower-
stalkS. Hence we have:

probability (p) of 1 flower-stalk = Ο,7271
>> 2 {lower-stalks = O,2473
» 3 v = 0‚0256

Often it is preferred to express these results saying that
in 72,71 (ἒξ, of all cases we may find a sample of Trientalis
europaea having 1 flower-stalk, in 24‚73 (ἐξ) we may find a
sample with 2 stalks and in 25ss (ἑξ, samples With 3 stalkS.
Ι will, however, generally prefer to use the ›>probabilities›> in-

stead of the procentual numbers,
It is now of essential importance to evaluate the un-

certainty of the probabilities thus found. Obviously the
uncertainty is smaller‚ the larger the number of counts is,
on which the calculation is based. More precisely, let Pbe
the total number of individuals considered (= the »popula-
tion›>), let N denote the number of individuals having one

flower-stalk and put

p = N .· P ς
q=1—p=(P—N):P‚

then the mean-error — e(p) —— in the probability p, through
which the uncertainty in p is mathematically defined, is given

by the formula
ε (20) == ss VJ}

Applying this formala to the above results we find:

probability of l {lower-stalk O‚7271 ss 0,0206
>> ‘2 {lower-stalks 0,2473 :k 0‚0200
2> 3 » O‚0256 ὲ 0‚0073

The mean-errors are given after the probabilitieS, sepa-
rated by the sign ss.

The above formula for the mean-error is valid‚ supposing
the theorem of BERNOULLI to be here applicable. Througha
division of the material I have found this to be very nearly
the case.
