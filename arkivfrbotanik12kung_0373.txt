WINGE, CYTOLOG. STUDIES IN THE PLASMODIOPHORACEAE. 19

merontic myxo-amoebae (fig. ll) is seen a granulous plasma
of somewhat rounded shape containing nuclei which in the
resting-stage are globular, provided with a membrane internal
to which is seen a· nuclear cavity filled with hyaloplasma‚
traversed by radial, slightly chromophilous filamentS. In
the centre 01 the nucleus is seen· a large nucleolus or a
caryosome which with the exception 01 some slightly con-
spicuous darker grains (fig. ll, 13, 14) (the idiochromatinZ)
are formed by a homogeneous substance which appears red
when stained with FLEMMING’s Three-Colour Process when
Safranin is employed prior to Gentianviolet. - In the fol-
lowing will be used the designations idiochromatin and tro-
phochromatin as they are used in MAIRE and Tisox’s memoir.⁵
-— When the myxo-amoeba nucleus is testing, the chromatin
proper, the idiochromatin, which later in the existence 01
the fungus forms the chromosomes and which, as previously
mentioned, is sometimes visible in the caryosome, must be
assumed to be partly resolved in the trophochromatin, which
latter forms the chromophilous filaments radiating from the
caryosome. —-

When the nuclei 01 011 amoeba —- always simultaneously
and most often with all axes situated in parallel planes -—- are
preparing for division they assume the form 01 ellipsoids or
spindles (118. 13, 14) and exhibit slight radiation-phenomena
at the poles 01 the spindle. I cannot say for certain that Ι
have ever seen true centrosomeS. Then the nucleus again
becomes almost round and the caryosome changes its appear-
ance (fig. 19, 20). The substance of the caryosome aggregates
in the equator of the nucleus while at the same time the
polar radiations become more pronounced. At this stage the
chromatin often aggregates in 3—4 bodies in the equator-
plane and may be very similar in appearance to chromosomeS.
By degrees the polar radiation again decreases in strength,
the nucleus once more assumes a short spindle-formed shape
almost like a square placed edgewise (fig. 21, 15, 22) and the
two kinds of chromatin separate, the vegetat-ive chromatin
or trophochromatin placing itself in the centre and the ge-
nerative chromatin or idiochromatin lying like a thin equa-
11011οΙ plate round it. The former appears red when stained
with FLEMMING’S Three-Colour Process like the chief mass of
the caryosome during the testing-stage, the latter appearS,
