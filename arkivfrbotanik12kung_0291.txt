EKMAN, NOMENCLATURE OF SOME NORTH-EUROPEAN DRABAE. 9

WILLD. (in Flora Lapponica ed. 1 p. 174) under which name
the latter had included both D. jladnizen-s’is WULF. and
Draba ciliaris HOST (= D. cz'lz'ata Scopom) non L. Sp. plant.
ed. IV WJLLDENOW t. 3 (1800) p. 428; cfr. HOPPE, Botanische
Zeitung 6 (1823) p. 445. In Flora Svecica ed. 1 (1824) p.
400 WAHLENBERG gives another name to the same plant
viz, Draba lapponica and extends at the same time
the term so as also to include a form with stellulate hairs
011 1116 surface of the leaves. C. J. HARTMAN gives it the
name of Draba Walzlenber9ii HN. in the first ed. (1820) of
Skandinaviens Flora p. 249, and the species is subsequently
divided by LmDBLoM into the forms homotrz'cha and hetero-
tricha (in Linnaea 1839 p. 324) which names are adopted by
HAR'rMAN 1849 10 1116 5111 ed. of the same work.

The former form only corresponds with Draba jladnz'-
zeusis er, the latter with D. lapponz'ca WG. Ι shall now
endeavour briefly to prove my case. — I was for a long
time doubtful whether the D. sladnz'zensis of v. W⁷ULFEN
was identical with D. Wahlenberqii HN. s. homotrz'cha LINDBL.
on account of the character of 2013 leaves on the stem which
he assigns to the plant (in Plantae rariores Carinthiacae in
Jacquins Miscellanea Austriaca p. 147-148 Tab. 17 f. l) as the
Northern Draba Walzlenberqii has generally only one leaf 00
1116 51610, 5010611065 0006. But having seen some specimens
af Draba sladnizensis in the collection of E. J. SMITH in
the Linnean Society (gatherad in 1816 by D. SIEBER, from
the classical locality near Fladnitz in Steiermark) which
quite agreed with our above mentioned form, my doubts were
dispelled. Nor have I in collections found any other form
of Draba which would better fit in with the description (l. 0.)
than this plant. — It seems evident to me that the pubes-
cence of D. Wahlenberqii HN. s. heterotricha LINDBL. does
not correspond with that of D. sladnizensis both from 1116
description and the reproduction l. l. c. c. where no stellu-
late hairs occur. One might, however, consider it to bc a
Northern form of D. sladnizensz's morphologically so nearly
allied to it, that it must be referred to this species, Ι con·
sider it more correct to call it an intermediate form between
D. sladnizensis and D. rupestriS. For most specimenS‚ which
have been called D. sladnizensis s. lapponica, or D. Wahlen-
berqz’i j. heterotricha‚ display such an irregularity, especially
