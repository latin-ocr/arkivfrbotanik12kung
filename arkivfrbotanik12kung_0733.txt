We find that the ›>roundness» of the leaves increases a
little, when the length of the leaves is decreasing.

10. Patala. Only a few samples were examined regarding
the length (l) and the breadth (b) of the petaIS. As, however,
the variability of these characters seems to be much smaller,
than that of the characters measured above,¹ the resulting
values of the means are tolerably well determined.

The individual values obtained were:

7,5 3,5

8‚0 3‚7

7‚6 3‚4
8‚0 3‚4

From which we deduce

¹ The coeffioient of variability (= 100 ᾗ) amounts indeed only toll ⁰lo

for the petals whereas for the characters before considered this coefficient
amounts to some ‘20 ⁰l0 or 30 ⁰l0.
