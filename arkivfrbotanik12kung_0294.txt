calities: Draba rupestris and D. alpina, in Central Europe: D.
carinthiam.

6. Draba nivalis L11.JEBL.

With the exception of D. crassisolia GRAHAM, D. flad-
nizensz‘s is the most glabrous of all Northern species. The
one with the thickest covering is D. nivalis. Both are »ho-
motrichozw», the one with simple 113113, 1110 other with the
most stellulate ones. Owing to their different pubescence
the two species seem to be morphologically the least affined
ones. The fruit in the hybrid between them (Draba ‘nivalis
β brachycarpa Lmnm... in Bot. Not. 1839 p. 19, Draba brachy-
carpa ZETTERST. in Bot. Not. 1854 p. 151, ηοη NUTTAL, Draba
curtisz'liqua ZETTERST. in Plantes vasculaires des Pyrenees
principales 1857 p. XLVIII) is also almost sterile, which is
not always the case between hybrids of this genUS, even
when the pollen is not very good.

Draba nivalis is first mentioned in Vetenskapsakademiens
handlingar 1793 p. 208 as found in the Lapp-territory of
Torne 1788. Τ110 plant was introduced in »Utkast till en
Svensk Flora» ed. 2 1798 p. 269, by S. LILJEBLAD and isillu-
strated in the same work fig. 35. The following year it was
more completely described (in Nova Acta Societatis Scienti-
arum Upsaliensis b. 6 p. 47 1799) with a good illustration
tab. 2 f. 2. By WALLMAN, who published a 3:d edition of the
Flora of LILJEBLAD (1816), 11 was called Draba Lily‘ebladz'i
WALLM. (p. 350). By WAHLENBERG in Flora Lapponica l ed.
1812 p. 174 it had been called Draba muricella WG. It
was not till 1839 that it was once more given its first name
by LINDBLOM (Linnaea 1839 p. 326) and after him also by
HARTMAN in the 5th ed. of Skand. Flora 1849 p. 112.

Under the name of D. nivalis WILLDENOW has combined
(in Species planta-rum ed. IV WILLDENow p. 427) both the
true D. nivalis LILJEBL. and a plant which was discoverd
by D. VILLARS on Mount Cenis and described by him under
the name of: ›>D. hirta C.» in Histoire des plantes du Dau-
phine t. 3 (1789) p. 283. After W1LLDEN0w J. P. DE CANDOLLE
adopts the name of D. nivalis and describes the plant from
