WINGE, CYTOLOG. STUDIES IN THE PLASMODIOPHORACEAE. 15

and ΤΙ5ΟΝ27 have transferred the fungus from Sorosphaera‚
where SOHWARTZ had placed it, to their new genus Lv'qniera.

Ligniera Graminis (SCHwAR'rz) VVINGE comb. nov.

This Plasmodiophoracea‚ described by SCHWARTZQG in 1911,
must like Sorosphaera Junci be transferred to the genus
Liqniera, as according to the author it does not produce
hypertrophy. The fungus was found in roots of Poa annua
and other grasses and most often in tumours 011 roots at-
18811811 by ecl-worm, the swellings were. never due to the
fungus, Also in this species the author has found amoebae
in root-hairs and he states: »doubtless it is the usual method
by which the members of the Plasmodiophoraceae enter their
host-plant». — SOHWARTZ did not succeed in infecting sound
Poa annua plantS.

We shall now proceed to describe a new Plasmodio-
phoracea which has already been mentioned a couple of times
in the literature and of which even illustrations have ap-
peared. .

ΚΑ11111111581111101111Ἴ and 110511110111128 (1870) give a detailed
description of the fungus and figure on a plate what they
see. They mention destruction of the host—plant, Callzftriche
autumnali& and state, that the fibro-vasal strings which
normally occupy the centre of the stalk-axis in the infected
organs move out into the cortical tissue. In the tubers the
cells become elongated in a radial direction and between
them are seen large spaces which are strongly developed
intercellulars. As regards the fungus itself they mention
that in the cells are 58811 1180111181, flat, plate-formed bodies
of constant thickneSS, but of very varying outline, 85 they
adapt themselves to the shape of the host-cells. The plates
consist of very small polygonal cells, arranged in two layers
and forming a parenchymatic tissue. These formatioris con-
tain in the cell-wall a considerable amount of silica. KAREL-
TSCHIKOFF looked upon these Spore—aggregations as cystoliths
