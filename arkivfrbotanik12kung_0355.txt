Communicat-ed June 5th 1912 by J. ERIKSSON and G. LAGERHEIM.

 

During a stay in Stockholm in the months 0106101061-
November 1910 Ι had occasion to undertake some cytological
investigations into the Plasmodiophoraceae, of which this
memoir is the result.

This paper in the first instance owes its existence to
Professor G. LAGERHEIM, who kindly supplied me with a well-
preserved material, collected by himself some years previously
in different localities in Norway and Sweden. Besides the
material itself some stained sections, cut on the microtome‚
were likewise placed at my disposal as also the figures of
the macroscopical habit of the Plasmodiophoraceae, found in
this paper. Disregarding the necessity of producing a few
micro-preparations and of staining anew some of the slides
already present, all I had to do was »to look». — In the
year 1901 LAGERHEIM had initiatcd a revision of the material
and had put down nearly everything known about this family
up till the said year. He had likewise given a thorough
description of the occurrence of Sorosphaera veronicae SOHROET.
and its attacks on the different species of Veronica. — This
unfinished manuscript Professor LAGERHEIM kindly handed

· over to me in order that I might employ it at pleasure. I

here seize the opportunity of rendering my best thanks to
him for this as well as for many other acts of friendliness
