Ι give here also (compare § 9) the values of t-he means
and the dispersione:

Breadth the os leaf:
M z 14,03 ss O,36
σ = 4,38 ss O‚25
σ : M :- O‚312.

Lenqth os the leaf:

Mz35‚52 ss 0,90
σ = 11‚11 ές Ο,63
0:]1[:0‚313.

Hence We have

breadth : length ε O,395.

Certainly there are several biologioal conclusione to be
drawn from the different characteristic& given above, I eon-
Sider it, however, mosi] judieious to leave those conclusions
to the biologistS.
