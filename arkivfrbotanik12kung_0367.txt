WINGE, CYTOLOG. STUDIES IN THE PLASMODIOPHORACEAE. 13

has the form of a plate — as was also later stated by BLOM-
FIELD and SCHWARTZ —- though the most chromophilous parts
are lying in the periphery of the plate as rather conspicuous
grains. The number of these is probably constant, but very
difficult to determine on account of their smallness and the
surrounding chromophilous substance. In several cases I have
observed that their number is not· very great.

During the first part of the sporogonic phase the nucle-
olus disappears totally (fig. 66 and 67), which according to
the description and illust-ration by MAIRE and TisON occurs
owing to the nucleolus (the caryosome) growing smaller and
smaller, and at last becoming pulverised into granula, when
a new nucleolus appears afterwardS‚ which immediately by
¹ the first of the two mitotical divisions again disappears
This new nucleolus Ι never saw nor any stage, at which the
nuclei are perfectly devoid of chromatical contentis, When
MAIRE and TISON says that for some time the nuclei are
seen only as weak lightnings in the plasma, I suppose that
it is average-cuts through a myx-amoeba —— cuts, in Which
only a part of the cavity of the nuclei is shown, not the
chromatica] parts — which have given it such an appearencc.
Several times Ι myself have got prepara-tions of apparently
empty cavities of nuclei, but as far as I can make out it is
alwayS, as mentioned above, a gleam-cut through a great
number of nuclei, — and that such cuts are possible may be
explained in this way that the nuclei very often are situated
on one level along the cell-wall of the host.

Strange to say BLOMFIELD and SCHWARTZ (1. c.) have
noticed the same total disappearance of the nuclei and the
same lightnings in the plasma and declare (p. 30) that »it
seems to us to be incertain whether the Vacuoles seen at
this stage are the remains of the vegetative nuclei or whether
they are freshly produced in the plasma.›>1 — On the con-
trary they do not mention the appearance of any nucleolus
after the disappearance of the first one at the transitional
stage between the vegetative and sporogone phaseS‚ but are
of. opinion that the nucleolus before disappearing becomes
»more irregular in shape and smaller in size», and that the

Graminis (Annals of Botany, vol. XXV, 1911) SCHWARTZ remarks about
the same vacuoles: »In these vacuoles apparently fresh nuclei are formed.»
