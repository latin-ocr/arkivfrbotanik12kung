in Norway under the name of ›>scurf›>. In the outmost
cell-layer of the tuber it appears at its earliest stage as
formless mucous masseS, and later on it looks like a coarsely
pored sponge. Finally the mucous masses become converted
into Spore balls, perforated all over so that the whole interior
of the spore-ball is like intersected by a trellis-work or net-
like system of spores which like a lattice-work supports the
spores situated in the periphery. This fungus has later been
found in different localitieS. Its habitat must be assumed
to be South America as LAGERHEIM36 found it at Quito.
It was here in such close connection with the filaments of
a fungus that LAGERHEIM was led to the conclusion that
these belonged to the organism itself — an assumption in Which
he was confirmed by oral and written communications from
fellow-scientistS. After a closer study of Sorosphaera a. 0.
LAGERHmM, however, changed his view of the matter to this,
that the filaments must all the same have been without·
genetic connection with the Spore-balls and only in a delusive
way they had grown through the Sponyospora tumourS. The
Spore-balls have probably (LAGERHEIM l. 0.) already at an
earlier date been observed by WALLROTH‚ MARTIUS and
BERKELEY, and Ros‘r-RUP37 likewise stateS‚ that BRUNCHHORST’s
organism is identical with Tubzcrcinia Scabies BERK.

It is really evident already from BRUNCHHORST'S investi-
gation (l. c.) that his Sponqospora Solani is no doubt an en-
dophytic mycetozo ¹which is closely related to the Plasmo-
diophoraceae mentioned, although our knowledge of the whole
development of the fungus is yet very imperfect. Sub-
sequently JOHNSON33 is of opinion that he has seen self-
moving amoebae in the cells underneath a patch of scurf.
He likewise mentions (l. c.) that by staining with cotton-
blue and lactic acid 3 darker points are seen in the spores‚
hence he is of opinion that the spores are plurinucleate. In
mature spores he finds the wall perforated and the contents
consisting of 2-3 self-moving bodieS, presumably swarming-
spores. In a subsequent paper 501111801139,52 confirmed that
the movable bodies in the spore are swarming-sporeS. He
states that at the germination of the spore 8 zoospores are as
a rule formed. In the nuclear conditions of the spore as
represented by -JOHNSON, points of resemblance are found in
the characteristic Ceralz'omyxa, whose cytology has been studied
