sporogonic stage. It commences in this way that the resting
globular schizont-nucleus becomes very slightly spindleformed
and exhibits radiation-phenomena from the poles (fig. 31)
where possibly two centrosomes are situated. At the same
time the caryosome enters into plainer connection with the
periphery of the nucleUS‚ as the hitherto thin chromatin·
filaments which have radiated from the caryosome become
more solid, the nuclear membrane disappears and the chro-
matin travels along the filamentS, preferably towards the
poles where two chromatic bodies are often formed (fig. 32—35).
Another modification which has frequently been observed
has been mentioned previously in Plasmodiophora by PRO-
WAZEK (l. c.), namely a sta-ge at which the chromatin is seen.
arranged in garlands which, at any rate in Sorodz'scus‘, are
most often attached to both poles (fig. 36, 37).

We now enter into the final sporogonic phase which is
characterized by two succeeding divisionS‚ a mitosis and a
meiosiS. The caryosome is now perfectly resolved, only the
chromatin-filaments are left and they arrange themselves so
that they chiefly travel from pole 10 pole and deposit the
chromatin in equator (fig. 38, 39) where a plate is thus formed,
namely the metakinetic chromatin plate essential to the next
nuclear division. Meantime the nucleus changes form and
becomes spindleformed‚ and the plasma of the amoeba (the
schizont converted into a sporont) commences slowly to sepa-
rate into small uninucleate Spore-mother cells which simulta-
neously pass through the following caryokinctic phases (fig. 40).
The polar radiation is still going on, but is now above maxi-
mum. The nuclear spindle‚ formed by the hyaloplasmatic
strings, is intranuclear (fig. 40, 43). The chromatin arranges
itself in 16 chromosomes (fig. 41), presumably arisen by the
splitting up of 8 chromosomeS‚ for most often two and two lie
nearer each other, and 8 chromosomes travel 10 both poles.
The two sets of chromosomeS‚ however, for a time keep up
the connection with each other by the aid of chromatio and
hyaloplasmatic strings (fig. 44, 45, 42). The daughter-nuclei
separate from each other as represented in fig. 42 and 46.
When the nuclei part, slight polar radiations are still seen.
Immediately afterwards the binucleate amoebae divide, so
that they again become uninucleate‚ but they do not grow
so much that they attain the size cf the former ones. Thon
