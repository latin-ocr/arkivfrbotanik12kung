Draba qelida TURCZ„ of which Ι have seen specimens at Kew,
presented by TURCZAMNow himself and with his description
of this plant in Flora Baicalense-Dahurica in Bulletin des
Naturalistes de Moscou t. XV (1842) (p. 249—2503).

But how are we to explain the origin of this Draba?

As we know D. C. SOLANDER made an exploratory tour
in the year 1756 111 the Swedish Lapp-territory of Pite and
its adjacent parts of Norway. During this journey D. hirta
was discovered according to a note in Fauna Svecica ed. 2
(1761) appendix p. 557. As we also know, Braya alpina
STERNB. et HOPPE, occurs in the Norvegian Nordlanden.
There are some specimens in the Museum of Stockholm‚
collected from Junkerdalen, which in habit also quite agreee
with the Linnean B7·aya to the right on the sheet. It is
possible that it was via Junkerdalen that SOLANDER, starting
from the Lapp-territory of Pite, entered Norway, when he
visited Rorstad on South Folden-Fjord. Perhaps it was
SOLANDER that gave LINNAEUS this Braya alpina, collected in
Junkerdalen‚ whereas LINNAEUS received the true D. hirta
from GMELUN, and, considering the two plants to be identical‚
had mounted them on the same sheet but had founded his
description of the species only upon tho Draba-specimen. For
both the diagnosis of LINNAEUS himself 1. l. 0. 0. and that
which he has quoted from GMELIN can only be referred to
the true D. hirta.

Another alternative might be that SOLANDER really gath-
ered D. hirta in Scandinavia f. 1. near Folden-Fjord as an
ephemera] immigrant from the shores of the Arctic Ocean
where forms affined to it occur.

Or, is the plant to be rediscovered somewhere in the
Swedish Lappony e. g. near the Lake of Virijauhre, where
it is possible SOLANDER passed on his way back from NorwayZ
Draba hirta seems to have been collected later in the year
— in August or September — than Braya alpi-na, which
probably was gathercd in June or July.

3. Draba rupestris R. BR.

The name of D. rupestris was first- given by ROBERT
BROWN (l. c.) to a plant which in 1789 was discovered by
