We find from this table that the number of leaves in
the rosule is considerably increasing with the number of
flower-stalkS. The mean number being 5‚54, 6‚3s and 7,s
respectively.

Regarding the number of leaves in the rosule there is
some irregularity in the counts owing to the fact that the
undermost (and smallest) leaf in the rosule sometimes is
attached to the stem at some distance beneath the ros'ule.
Generally I counted it as belonging to the rosule as soon as
this distance was smaller than 5 mm.

The numbers of leaves in the rosule for samples with l
flower-stalk form what I have called a frequency-curve of
type B, whereas the other characters here considered (ex-
cepting the number of flower-stalks ξ 1) give rise tc, approxi-
mately, frequency curves of type A. There is no reason to
charaterize more exactly the nature of these frequencysscurveS‚
taking into regard the small number of classes. I have not
even considered it appropriate to calculate the mean values
of each character, which are only exceptionally given above
for the number of leaves in the rosule (for different numbers
of flower·stalks).

B) Heterograde statis'ticS.

The characters examined were the length and thickness
of the rootstock, the stem and the {lower-stalkS, length and
breadth of the leaves in the rosule, of the petals and, the
sepaIS, length of the stamens and of their separate parts as
well as of the pistils.

time-absorbing I have only examined 11 samples regarding
the dimensions of the radices. The result obtained, in milli-
meters as for all other characterS‚ was
