died 1821), and was marked by him as received from COM-
MERSON. Now we must bear in mind that LAMARCK also found-
ed his diagnosis (in Encyclopedie Methodique, Botanique t.
2, p. 328, 1786) upon a specimen from the herbarium of
COMMERSON. This plant at Kew is thus as good as a type
specimen. It consistS‚ as HOOKER also remarks, of a single
stem »probably one of several». Perhaps one of the others
was just the one described by LAMAROKZ

This Draba mayellanica at Kew is a typical Draba
arctz'ca with very dense covering. Identical with it are
also other specimens of the same species at Kew, the Natural
History Museum in London and in the collections of Upsala
University that I have seen. (Those in the Stockholm Mu-
seum do not all appear to me to be so typical.) Not all of
them have such a dense covering. However, I have not seen
the most glabrous form, (D. hirta s. Zeiocarpa LINDBL. l. c.
p. 330) represented from the South hemisphere. If I had to
pich upon a distinguishing characteristic for the Ant-arctio
form3 it would be the entire or very slightly serrated leaves
even in specimens of a certain heigth e. g. 25 cm.

It is true that specimens from Greenland often have
very slighty serrated or entire leaveS, but then the plant is not
as a rule so high. Plants with more serrated leaves are
mostly found at a somewhat lower latitude of the Nothern
hemisphere‚ e. g. North Scandinavia and Dovre. The
Antarctic specimens are as often branched as those from
Scandinavia‚ Sibiria or North America‚ where the plant often
is called Draba arabisans MICH., Draba §flabella PUSH.‚ Draba
H enneana SCHLECHT., Drabcz yellestoniana AVE NELSON. I have
only seen high, branched Greenlandic specimens from Disce,
collected by Professor TH. M. FRIES.

I have not broached the question whether the high D.
φηαῃεῖῖαηίεα, with stellulate pubescence and several leaves
on the stem might be the Draba hirta of LINNAEUS, as it
seems to be impossible from his very diagnosis in Systema
Naturoe ed. X (1759) p. 1127 and his description in Species
plantarum ed. II t. 2 (1763) p. 897. A specimen of D. ‘mayel-¹
lemica LAM. was however collected by LINNAEUS himself during
his tour in Lappony in 1732, and, together with other plantS,
given to BURMAN. This herbarium of ΒΠΒΜΑΝ, which is now
in Paris, has been described by Professor ΤΗ. Μ. FRIES (in
