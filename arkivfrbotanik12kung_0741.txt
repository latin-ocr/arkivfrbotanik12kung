From this table we get
r= -1- 0321ss 0,080‚

so that even here a positive correlation is manifested, though
not so well defined as that between the thickness of the
stem and the length of the longest leaf.

18. Correlation between the Zenqth os the slower-stalk and
the thickness os the stem. There were 78 samples examined
as given below,

Lenqth of the slower-stalk

hence even here a pronounced positive correlation.
