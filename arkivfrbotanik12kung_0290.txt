forma α stellata DICKSON‚ for the other one that of D. ru-
pestrz’s R. BROWN, forma β hirta SMITH.

The question is now: Is the real D. rupestris to be found
in scandinavia?

From Mount Kvaernskaret near Roraas in Norway I
have gathered a form which as to every essential character
agrees with the Scottish forma α with a heterotrichous pu-
bescence of stellulate hairs. In collections I have also seen
specimens with the genuine character of D. rupestris: a pu-
bescence of mainly simple hairs from Harjedalen‚ Jamtland
and the Lapp-territories of Lule and Torne in Sweden.

In forms from Dovre in Norway the stellulate pubescenee
of the leaves is generally dominant. However, it seems to me
as if this latter form, as well as all Northern Leucodrabae
with a heterotrichous covering of the leaveS‚ pure white flo-
werS, even when dried, and podS, somewhat longer than the
pedicels for the present might be referred to D. rupestriS.
In practice this would be all that has been called D. hirta,
after having excluded from it D. mayellanica LAM. and its
subspecieS. Our Scandinavian tribe of D. rupest‘ris will cer-
tainly have sooner or later to be divided into several Species,
There are sufficiently different combinations of characters
to justify us in so doing. I have had the opportunity of
seeing how several of these forms are constant in culture.
Others again have prooved to be only local forms, Thus
the Draba scandinavica men„ l. c. (= Draba rupestrisss
stricta LmDBLBOe. Not. 1841 p. 221) has proved to be only
a local form of Draba laxa LINDBL. (——— Draba rupestris) 1. l.
c. c.‚ which, cultivated in a shady place, passes over into
the latter.

4. Draba fladnizensis WULF. 5Draba lapponica We.

The name of Draba jladnizensis WULF. was introduced
in Scandinavia for the first time in the Flora of Sweden by
Messrs NEUMAN and AHLFVENGREN (1901), probably after
GELERT. (1. c. p. 303; Sveriges Flora by Id. M. NEUMAN and

Fa. AHLFVENGREN p. 475). It is true, WAHLENBERG had ’

already 1812 used it as a synonym for Draba androsaceae
