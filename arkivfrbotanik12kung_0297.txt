EKMAN, NOMENCLATURE OF SOME NORTH-EUROPEAN DRABAE. 15

9. Draba incana L.

At length we now come to the only Scandinavian species
that has been referred to the Section H olarqes 01 DE CANDOLLE.
(As D. mayellanica has been called D. ineam-hirta, it has
been ranged amongst the Leucodrabae.)

As we know LINDBLOM united the Sections C'hmsodrabae,
Leucodrabae and Holaryes in 0 new one under the name of
Drabae. It seems to me he had good scientific reasons for so
doing. Among our Northern species D. crassisobia belongs
perhaps by its two forms 01 0010111 both to CMywdmbw and
Leucodraboe and D. mayellanica by its perennation to Leuco-
dmhw, by its sometimes branched stems to Holar9e3‚· and
finally D. incana is not biennal‚ at any rate not most forms
01 11; some individuals seems 10 be 1110111110] 0111013 perennial.
The species seems to be still in evolution from bienna] to
perennial.

In the North it has as a rule 1101 proved difficult 10
distinguish D. incana from other specieS, though intermediate
forms — probably mostly hybridous —- are found, on the
one hand 10 D. mayellam'ca 011 1110 011101 10 D. rupestriS.

A constant characteristic is the dense pubescence 011110
short pediceIS.

The division of EHRHART 01 11113 species into Draba con-
fusa and Draba contorta (Beitrage 7 1792, p. 155) 1103 caused
some confusion. I have had the opportunity of seenig how
HARTMAN’S objection to it (l. 0. ed. ll p. 106) 13 perfectly
just. Viz. the characters which ERHART assigns to the re-
spective Nothern forms are not always thus combined in
nature. The name 01 D. confusa was applied by A. P. DE
CANDOLLE in Systema Regni Vegetabilis tom. 2 (1821) p.
348 10 0 plant from Central Europa, differing from D. incana
by 113 longer style, 113 311101101 flowers and its pubescence 01
3011 31011111010 110113. In the same sense it is used by L.
REICHENBAOH, who gives an illustration 01 1110 plant- in
Plantae Criticae tab. 770 11ῑο 1033. In 1818 J. GAY has
already given it· the name of Draba stylaris GAY (in E.
THOMAS Cat„ a work which has not been accessible to me,
but which perhaps contains a catalogue of 1110 plants in the
herbarium 01 GAUDIN. As a synonym to D. confusa DC.
