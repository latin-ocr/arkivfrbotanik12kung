24 ARKIV Fon BOTANIK. BAND 12. Nzo 14.

It is to be remarked that the value of the dispersion of
the thickness of the stem deduced from this table did not

agree (taking into account the mean-errors) with the value
of this character found in ξ 7. In that ξ we. obtained

σ = O‚189 ss 0,009‚

whereas the table above gives

σ = O‚101:1: 0,008.

I have been unable to explain the difference between
these valueS, which show that the 78 samples of this ξ are
— in respect to the thickness of the stem -, in some
manner, systematically taken out from the 236 samples con-

sidered in § 7.

19. ‚Correlation between the breadth and the lenqth os the
Zonyest leaf in the rosule. In respect to this pair of charac-
ters I have cxamined 152 sampleS, distributed into classes
as is shown from the following correlation-table.

As could be expected -— which even can be directly seen
from the correlation-table — there is a rather strong corre-

lation between these characters, We get indeed

r = 4- Ο,892 ss O,037.
