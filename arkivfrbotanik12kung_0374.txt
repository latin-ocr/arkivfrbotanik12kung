under high magnifying powerS, as a lot of dark grains which
are especially conspicuous in the periphery of the plate. In
a few cases the edge of the plate appeared as a distinct

Α zigzag design (fig. 22) which intimates‚ that the distribution

of the chromatin to the daughter-nuclei takes place with
considerable regularity.

Later on the nucleus becomes more oblong (fig. 16) and
thereby also the trophochromatin-body¹ Which by degrees
assumes the shape of a hand-weight while at the same time
the idiochromatic plate is split in two, the fate of which I
am not able to account for owing to the remarkably few
instances of this stage. But the two plates no doubt travel
each towards its own pole, and the trophochromatin goes
out right to the apices of the spindle. Shortly afterwardS‚
while the daughter-nuclei are still coherent (fig. 23, 24), two
distinct daughter-caryosomes become visible and in these
some darker bodies which are no doubt the idiochromat-in.
The two nuclei then divide and slowly become rounded. The
radiating chromatin-filaments are very conspicuous at this
stage. A remarkable feature which NAWAsoH1N3 already
mentions with regard to Plasmodiophora is, that. at the close
of the anaphase one often sees something like a common
membrane which still connects the two daughter-nuclei so
that one gets the impression, that they are free cells not
nuclei (fig. 17, 18, 25). What this membrane is, is hard to
say, possibly it is a chemical precipitation-product on the
boundary between the nucleus and the surrounding cyto-
plasma. A few times I have seen a distinct centrodesmose
still connecting the caryosomes after the daughter-nuclei had
divided (fig. 30). Similar cases have been observed in many
other organisms of lower order e. g. in Gymnodz'nium suco-
rum3'2 KUSTER‚ in Trypanosomassss and others,

This method of nuclear division is now repeated several
times (fig. 26—29), the amoebae becoming schizonts with up
to 16 nuclei, By ordinary division the schizonts form bi· or
few-nucleate meronts which grow large and after lively nu-
clear divisions form secondary schizonts a. s.. ο. It is seen
that the amoebae-nuclei grow larger and larger in time, in
the first amoebae-generations they were quite small (fig. 11, 12).

Then follows a transitional stage during which the nuclei
are subject to some changes before they enter into the final
