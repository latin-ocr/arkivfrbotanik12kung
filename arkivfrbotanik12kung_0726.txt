From these numbers I obtain (›>Grunddragen›> Kap.III):

M = 126111111 ss 6‚s

Regarding the thickness of the stem I have examined
236 individuls. Ordering them into classes having a class-
breadth (w) of O¹¹¹¹¹²‚10, I have obtained the following frequen·
cies (F).

The thickness was measured with the help of an ocular-
mikrometer, which allowed the evaluation of the thickness
with an average error of Omm,01. Generally the evaluation
was rounded up to the nearest 5-hundredth of a millimeter.

For examining the correlation between the thickness of
the stalk and the number of flower-stalks, I have discussed
separately the values of the thickness for samples withl
stalk and with 2 stalks. There were 160 samples with 1
stalk and 76 with 2 stalks, which gave:
