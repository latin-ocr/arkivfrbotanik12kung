verlaufen Reste des zersprungenen Gefassbiindelringes in
Form kleiner Cribrovasalbiindel. Sie haben einen geschlan-
gelten Verlauf, sind oft sehr verzerrt und bestehen haupt-
sachlich aus oft unvollstandig und unregelmassig ausgebildeten
Spiralgefassem Porengefasse, die im normalen Gefassbiindel-
ring das Succedanholz bilden, sind sparlich oder fehlen

As regards the infection of Sorosphaera Veronicae BLOM-
FIELD and ὃοῌνιτΜιΤΖ22 report that it takes place near the
»growingpoint›>, and later MAIRE and TISON23 arrive at the
same result (›>au voisinage du point vegetatis») ,It is, however,
not allowable to speak of a »growingpoinw as regards a
phanerogamic plant; hence it it impossible to know, whether
the authors mean the most pronounced growing-zones or the
point of the stem. BLOMFOELD and SCHWARTZ (1. c.) made
a simple trial, which succeeded. Some seeds of Ver-onim„ were
sown in a pot and were spurt with water containing spores
from dry tumours of Sorosphaera. The roots were never
att-acked by the fungus Unfortunately we don’t know any-
thing about the germination of the spores and the infection
itself‚ which would bc of great value for the knowledge of
the biology of the fungus. But all the phases from the time
shortly after the infection until the maturity of the spores
are fully elucidated by MAIRE and TISON and likewise by
BLOMFOELD and SCHWARTZ. The last named authors pu-
blished their paper six months after MAIRE and TISON, and
independently they came to exactly the same result3 the
French authors are but more explicit. We shall not dwell
on the interesting resultS‚ found by these authors; besides
on a large scale they correspond with the results of NAWA-
SCHIN (l. c.) on Plasmodiophora‚ except as regards the mistake
corrected as above mentioned by PROWAZEK (l. c.).

As regards my own studies in the cytology of this fungus
I may nearly in extenso confirm their results, Only two
points in the life-cyclus may be commented upon. In the
vegetative phase when the nuclei are in the prophase the
chromatin is divided into trophochromatin and idiochromatin,
the latter surrounding the former (fig. 65). According to
MAmss and TISON the idiochromatin has the form of a ring.
By focusing up and down and by regarding the prophase
from different sides it becomes evident- that the idiochromatin
